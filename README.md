## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/XinyiLeo/MLproject.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Introduction
I finally finish one of my dream this year to play with some codes in stock indexes estimation. In January to Martch I made some literature research for a wide-used hidden markov - stochastic volatility models, see [Literature Research](https://github.com/XinyiLeo/Samples/blob/master/Xinyi%20Wu_433%20final%20report.pdf). Later in Machine learning course, I used software like Weka to give some baseline predictions and finally understood and revised some codes in HMM stock prediction. This is my first ML project in finance. Regard it as prototype, because it is far from mature to put in to reality algo trading.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/XinyiLeo/MLproject.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
